## Login to EC2 instance 
Depending on your computerâ€™s OS there are various methods to login to your ec2 instance 

###   Linux Based Systems and Mac OS
Download private key from Chime room

Change permissions of your private key so that only you can use it. 
```
chmod 400 /path/L2H.pem SSH into you instance 
ssh -i /path/ L2H.pem ec2-user@[See your IP at Chime Room] 
```

You should see a response like the following 
```
The authenticity of host 'ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com (10.254.142.33)'
can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 1f:51:ae:28:bf:89:e9:d8:1f:25:5d:37:2d:7d:b8:ca:9f:f5:f1:6f. 
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? 
Click Yes 
```

### *Windows* 
Convert the .pem file to .ppk file for use with putty 

Open Putty terminal and enter ec2-user@[IP at you name card] in the hostname 
 
Load the ppk file 
 

Click open to start a putty session 


### Step-3: Test EC2 instance connectivity

```

```

You should see a response like the following
```
